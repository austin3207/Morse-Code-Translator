# Morse-Code-Translator

This is a C# Console-app that translates a sentence into 
Morse code. The morse translation of each character is
read from a text file and stored in a 2D-array for easy 
access. I limited the characters to the Aphabet and the 
numbers 0-9. The program keeps running until the sentinel
value of 0 is entered.
